        <description>The 35-year-old man in his 30s was gunned down about 10:15 p.m. on Cambie Street near 19th Avenue in an apparent gangland slaying that had gone wrong. Soomel was in fact not the intended victim, and the person believed to be the target that day was Randy Naicker, who would later be murdered on June 25th, 2012, in Port Moody. On June 20, 2014, 35-year-old Kevin Jones and 32-year-old Colin Stewart were arrested and charged with first degree murder.  They were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility of parole for 25 years.</description>

        <name>Michael Ciro Nestoruk - April 9, 2009</name>
        <description>The body of the 42-year-old homeless man who was missing a leg and confined to a wheelchair was found on the grounds of Carleton elementary school in east Vancouver. In December 2017, Aaron Dale Power was found guilty of the second-degree murder of Nestoruk. Initially Power came to the attention of police when it was revealed that he was in the company of Nestoruk on the day before the slaying. The two men had been using crack cocaine together. A reward was offered for information about the murder, with police withholding information that the rock was the suspected murder weapon, but nothing came of it and police did not have enough evidence to lay charges. But an undercover police operation was launched in early 2014 which resulted in Power confessing that he had committed the slaying, using a rock to strike Nestoruk over the head.</description>
